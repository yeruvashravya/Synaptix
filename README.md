Anomaly Detection in Time Series Using Anomaly Transformer Detecting anomalies in time series data is a challenging task, especially when labeled datasets are unavailable. Traditional methods often analyze individual data points or simple pairwise relationships, but they fail to capture the complex dependencies within time series data. The Anomaly Transformer addresses this challenge by leveraging its anomaly-attention mechanism, enabling it to analyze the entire sequence of data. This approach allows the model to uncover intricate dependencies and patterns that traditional methods often miss, making it highly effective in detecting anomalies, even in the absence of labeled data.

The model utilizes prior association and series association to better understand the underlying structure of the data. Prior association helps capture global patterns in the data, while series association focuses on local dependencies. To further enhance the anomaly detection, the minmax strategy is employed, maximizing the difference between normal and anomalous data points, making anomalies more distinguishable.

For anomaly scoring, the model computes a reconstruction loss based on the discrepancy between the prior association and the series association, measured using KL divergence. This discrepancy is used to calculate an anomaly score via a dot product, which effectively identifies anomalies by highlighting deviations from expected patterns.

Based on the anomaly score, the model detects anomalies without the need for labeled data, making it a powerful tool for time series anomaly detection in various domains.Using the transformer here has been a great advantage and has been an easy and efficient manner to identify and detect the anomalies.
